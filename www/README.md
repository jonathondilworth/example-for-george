# www
Stands for world wide web, and **is a common** folder within /var/ that is utilised by webservers as the web accessible directory.

This is where we would commonly place files such as index.php. It's important to note that index.php may include references to files outside of the web accessible directory. A common convention is to store parameters (such as username and password credentials) outside of the web accessible directory.

See index.php
